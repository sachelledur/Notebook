the process of converting my physical artefact into a digital one I used the Trnio iPhone application which at first was difficult to use. 
I went to Parliment Hill and found the most interesting statued object I could find with a piece of history I had no idea about.
I have chosen this app method because it was easier to keep track of progress and useful information. (Such as, location, time, and progress of the artefact)
I did not rely on much evidence.

This artefact is a bell taken from the ruins of the clock tower destroyed by the fire of February 1916.
It is important because it is a piece of history that was able to be preserved since the fire. It is important to me because as an American, I had little to no knowledge on this fire and a lot of Canadian history.
I produced this 3D model by circling around the statued bell.
I did this model on one try. I went when it was fairly cold and windy out, my hands were freezing. I just knew that with my hands being so cold, I'd be able to limit being fidgety and maintain a good steady motion around the bell.
