the process of converting my physical artefact into a digital one I used the Trnio iPhone application which at first was difficult to use. 
I went to Parliment Hill and found the most interesting statued object I could find with a pieve of history I had no idea about.
I have chosen this app method because it was easier to keep track of progress and useful information. (Such as, location, time, and progress of the artefact)
I did not rely on much evidence.
