I remember thinking at first, there's no way I am going to be able to do this, I have no idea where to start, if I wanna try a new artifact, many thoughts of just doubt and ambiguity.
I started by not stressing myself out with trying to make a brand new artifact because I had no clue what would mix well with my bell.
Being able to make a sonification out of my object just seemed like the most perfect thing to do.
I started off by making my bell downloadable on SketchFab, and then downloading the model.
I then took the data from the .obj and opened it in Sublime. What I found weird was that every other column had begun with 'v' and the rest, with 'vn'.
I decided to copy six lines and copy every other line beginning with 'v' and pasting them into Microsoft Word so I wouldn't confuse myself when making the rows.
I made the rows and went onto MusicAlgorithms and input the pitches in the 3 voices. I got a bit confused when I noticed that my last row had consisted of negatives, but I decided to roll with it to see what could come from it.
I then listened and it sounded like a broken bell, I changed the beats per minute to see if I can get something that sounded like a church bell tower.
It wasn't until I listened to the sound when I realized that it was perfectly imperfect. I loved it, the sound matched my 3D object.
It was eerie sounding, as if something horrible was going to happen soon, which just reminds me of the tragic fire of 1916, where the bell initially was found amongst the ruins after.
The file wasn't greatly supported by SoundCloud, meaning the .midi file was taking way too long to upload in which i converted it to an .mp3 file.
